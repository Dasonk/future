Description: This is a convenience package for those stuck with R
    versions that are behind the times.  This will attempt to allow you
    to use some of the functions that were introduced in the newer
    versions of R.  Not all functions will be guaranteed to be imported
    so updating is preferred.  If, however, you can't update for one
    reason or another... this might help you out.  This package
    is only a convenience to load the corresponding future packages
    that are necessary to bring your version of R more up to date.
