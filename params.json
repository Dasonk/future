These other packages essentially provide the best approximations to the functions introduced in specific versions of R so that users stuck with older versions of R can still have access to some of these nicer functions.\r\n    \r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCurrently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).\r\n\r\nYou can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/future/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/Dasonk/future/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n## Make sure your current packages are up to date\r\nupdate.packages()\r\n## devtools is required\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"future\", \"Dasonk\")\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
